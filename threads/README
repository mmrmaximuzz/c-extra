You may experience problems with compiling executables in this directory. GCC
and Clang support almost all C11 features but not all C libraries do. glibc
supports C11 threads starting with 2.28. If your platform uses older glibc you
have no way to build the executables with it. The best option is to try linking
the executable against the musl C library. To do that you can download and build
musl library and compile with musl-gcc (see musl_make.sh build script).
